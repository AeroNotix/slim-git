Installation instructions for Login.app


NOTE!
--------------------------------------------------------------
Installing this program requires root access and should only
be done by people who is familiar with the system /etc/inittab
file. Since installing requires you to make changes in this
file, as described below, it is important that you know what 
these changes does to your system. If you edit this file in 
a completely wrong way your computer may not boot correctly 
any more. You should be aware of this!



Requirenemts
--------------------------------------------------------------
- libXpm 4.9 (or newer)
	Not tested with older versions than 4.9.
	Older versions may or may not work!
	Available at ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/libs/X/

- root access
	To be able to complete the installation you need to
	make changes in the system /etc/inittab file.



Installation
--------------------------------------------------------------
1) If needed, edit Config.h to fit your system

	- If you want to change the default path set by Login.app you
	  can modify DEFAULT_PATH in Config.h.

	- By default the ~/.xinitrc file is executed when a user is 
	  logging in. If you want a different file to be executed 
	  change the LOGIN_CMD in Config.h. 

	- If your system is not a Linux system you maybe need to change
	  the HALT_CMD and REBOOT_CMD in Config.h.

2) % ./build
3) % su
4) % cp Login.app /usr/local/bin
5) Edit /etc/inittab to look something like this:

	[...]
	id:5:initdefault:
	[...]
	x:5:respawn:/usr/local/bin/Login.app >& /dev/null

	The ">& /dev/null" will redirect all the messages printed by 
	the X-server to /dev/null (all the messages will be thrown
	away).  

	NOTE! These changes discribes how a RedHat 4.2/5.0 Linux system
	could be configured. It could look a little bit different on
	other unix platforms. For example on a Slackware Linux system
	it looks like this:

	[...]
	id:4:initdefault:
	[...]
	x1:4:respawn:/usr/local/bin/Login.app >& /dev/null

	ALSO NOTE! Before you modify your /etc/inittab make sure that
	your X-server is configured correctly and that Login.app is 
	working ok. Log in as root and execute the same line you will 
	put in your /etc/inittab from the console, for example:
	/usr/local/bin/Login.app, this way you can avoid unpleasant
	respawns of the X-server if something isn't working correctly. 

6) % exit
7) Reboot your system! (or just switch runlevel)
